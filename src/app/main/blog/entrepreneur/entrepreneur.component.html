            {{ article.description }} Initially it was thought that only
            existing candy companies like <b>Mars Wrigley</b> and
            <b>Hershey's</b> would reign supreme, leaving little to no room for
            the little guy, but the landscape has changed, and every year new
            entrepreneurs are coming to the spotlight. So what's changed?

          <p>
            Well, we are living the era of the internet and social media. It's
            never been easier to connect with people and establish global trade
            in the history of the human race than it is today. Today, people can
            market themselves through platforms like youtube, Facebook,
            Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and create a brand around themselves all
            for free. And this is what is allowing the little guy to compete
            with the big brands, or at least get their foot in the door.

            #Entrepreneur anyone?
          </h3>

          <p>
            Just a heads up if anyone is wondering, it takes more than putting
            <b>#Entrepreneur</b> in your social media bio...
          </p>

          <p>
            In short, it often takes hard work and being consistent in what you
            do. Now I'm not going to get too technical into entrepreneurship,
            but I am going to take a look at some modern day candy
            entrepreneurs, and see what they've done differently.

            Powerlifter Influencer Candy Connoisseur
          </h3>
          <p>
            If you guys read my last blog:
            <a [routerLink]="['/', 'my-journey-into-sour-strips']"
              >My Journey Into Sour Strips</a
            >, it was around this point in time that I had to know who the guy
            behind the amazing candy was. That's when I found out about
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRZAa0ay5dZT71_efD-YlOg"
              target="_blank"
              >Maxx Chewning</a
            >
            and how <a href="https://www.sourstrips.com/">Sour Strips</a> came
            to be.
          </p>

          <p>
            So the goal of any business to solve a problem. Maxx recognized the
            following problems:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A lot of sour candy just sucks...
            </li>
            <li>
              Why's the candy wet and sticky??
            </li>
            <li>Who's approving the sour meter?</li>
            <li>
              Adults eat candy too. Why's sour candy seem to only be marketed
              towards children?
            </li>
            <li>
              Is "extreme sour" really as sour as the manufactor can make it?
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            It was at this point that Maxx started looking into starting his
            candy brand. He contacted several candy companies and was initially
            turned away as they supplied only to large brands. But Maxx
            continued his journey until he found a supplier that could provide
            candy that he liked. And that's when he came across the supplier for
            sour belts.
          </p>

          <p>
            As soon as he tried the sour belts that the supplier sent him, at
            the moment he realized that sour belts were the candy he wanted to
            put his brand around. The candy was already perfect and addressed
            all the candy problems he had.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sour belts aren't available in your local Walmart. Usually you gotta
            find a candy-only store to find them. He didn't reinvent candy, or
            create some new healthy formula candy. From there it was all about
            building his brand and making his candy available everywhere.
