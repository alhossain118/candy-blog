            {{ article.description }} Initially it was thought that only
            existing candy companies like <b>Mars Wrigley</b> and
            <b>Hershey's</b> would reign supreme, leaving little to no room for
            the little guy, but the landscape has changed, and every year new
            entrepreneurs are coming to the spotlight. So what's changed?

          <p>
            Well, we are living the era of the internet and social media. It's
            never been easier to connect with people and establish global trade
            in the history of the human race than it is today. Today, people can
            market themselves through platforms like youtube, Facebook,
            Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and create a brand around themselves all
            for free. And this is what is allowing the little guy to compete
            with the big brands, or at least get their foot in the door.

            #Entrepreneur anyone?
          </h3>

          <p>
            Just a heads up if anyone is wondering, it takes more than putting
            <b>#Entrepreneur</b> in your social media bio...
          </p>

            In short, it often takes hard work and being consistent in what you
            do. Now I'm not going to get too technical into entrepreneurship,
            but I am going to take a look at some modern day candy
            entrepreneurs, and see what they've done differently.

            If you guys read my last blog:
            <a [routerLink]="['/', 'my-journey-into-sour-strips']"
              >My Journey Into Sour Strips</a
            >, it was around this point in time that I had to know who the guy
            behind the amazing candy was. That's when I found out about
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRZAa0ay5dZT71_efD-YlOg"
              target="_blank"
              >Maxx Chewning</a
            >
            and how <a href="https://www.sourstrips.com/">Sour Strips</a> came to be.

          <candy-youtube-player id="LvDYgSWT8F0"></candy-youtube-player>

          <p>So the goal of any business to solve a problem. Maxx recognized the following problems:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A lot of sour candy just sucks...
            </li>
            <li>
             Why's the candy wet and sticky??
            </li>
            <li>Who's approving the sour meter? </li>
            <li>
              Adults eat candy too. Why's sour candy seem to only be marketed towards children?
            </li>
            <li>
              Is "extreme sour" really as sour as the manufactor can make it?
            </li>
          </ul>
