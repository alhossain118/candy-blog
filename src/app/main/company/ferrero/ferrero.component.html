  In the 1940s, Pietro Ferrero transformed a pastry shop into a factory. The
  Ferro Family was the first Italian manufacturer after World War 2 to open
  production sites and offices abroad in the confectionary sector, which brought
  about making the company into an international group.

  In 1946, Pietro Ferrero a confectioner and small-time pastry maker added
  hazelnut as a way to save money on chocolate. This innovation led to the
  development of Nutella. Today, The Ferrero Group is considered the 3rd largest
